While most verifications are completed quickly, delays can occur due to:\n- Incomplete or blurry document uploads\n- Mismatch between your ID and selfie\n- High traffic during peak hours\n- Network issues or app version conflicts\n\nTo avoid delays, make sure to:\n- Use the latest version of the Socious Wallet app.\n- Have a clear photo ID ready (passport, national ID, or driver's license).\n- Take your selfie in good lighting, without filters or glasses.\n- Follow the instructions on the Credentials page and select \"Verify now\" using Veriff.\n- After successful verification, your dashboard banner will turn green â€” and youâ€™re ready to support projects! ðŸŽ‰\n\nIf you're still stuck, feel free to contact support via Info@socious.io"
